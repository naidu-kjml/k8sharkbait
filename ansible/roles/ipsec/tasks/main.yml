# Tasks to configure ipsec tunnels between nodes in the cluster
# Assume that pre-generated certificates and keys are present in ../files/
# so that we have files like this:
# - ca.crt.pem , the ca certificate
# - host1.crt.pem
# - host1.key.pem
# - host2.crt.pem
# - host2.key.pem
# - host3.crt.pem
# - host2.key.pem
# I've generated them via radiac's caman script because I use it for other stuff
# alternatively, just use a pre-shared key
